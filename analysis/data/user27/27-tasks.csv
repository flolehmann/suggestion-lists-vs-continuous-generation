270;1;0;For my last vacation I went to the North Sea. My mother, my stepfather and me drove the way up to join a family gathering.\nThe day before and the the day after we spent walking across the beach and visiting friends and family. The weather was warm and sunny and we enjoyed every second of it.\nDuring the main event we stayed in a 4 star hotel and had plenty of good food and drinks.;160.75360405491665;0;0;0;5;5;5;5;3;4
271;1;1;For my last vacation I wen to spend some time at the North Sea with my parents and a few of my friends. I found that the northern shore was fairly quiet and quiet was always better than solitude. As we joined a family gathering and listened to the music, the sea seemed to become a much quieter place. When I looked down at my feet while I was standing at the water I saw that the sand had little crabs in it.\nThe before and after the gathering we spent a lot of time in the water watching the sea and watching my dad go fishing.;194.87293988699093;3.113326090388;5;0;5;4;5;4;5;5
272;1;2;For my last vacation I went to the North Sea and took a look at some great places on the coast, some of which have amazing beaches and the other that are nothing special but still worth a look.\n\nThe family gathering me and my parents joined was a great trip and we both got to have a few beers. My family and I had a fantastic time walking through some of the oldest towns on the coast and a visit to some old friends. \n\nWe were all so relaxed and a lot of the friends from out of town were very friendly and seemed very relaxed too.\n\nOur trip took about 4 days in total.;174.92597617488354;4.460596056655049;23;4;4;5;5;5;5;5
