283;1;2;In last June I visited Naples for the first time. I found the city very strange. I had heard of it from a few sources, that it might be very criminal and dangerous. I was expecting a peaceful city, but I felt like I was in another country, somewhere where crime and corruption are not a problem. I spent some time at the museum and discovered that this place is completely different than my previous experiences.\n\nWhen I arrived at the city center, I decided to head for a bar to get some fresh air. It was quite confusing to see so many cultures mixing, so I decided to explore some bars and restaurants. Some bars were more touristy than others, and they weren 't the best places to visit. But I found a nice place to chill out and eat.;275.65162281272933;6.521039611194283;34;13;2;2;3;2;2;5
284;1;0;In January I‘m going to visit Canada for the first time. I saw beautiful pictures but I‘m a bit afraid of the low temperatures. Usually I freeze very easily so I need to shop some appropriate winter clothing first. Nevertheless I can‘t wait to explore a North American country for the first time. Especially Quebec seems to have some beautiful sights I‘m eager to explore.\nLet‘s see, what will expect me.;201.30771851632744;0;0;0;4;3;5;4;2;2
285;1;1;In January I‘m going to visit Canada for the first time. I‘m already very excited to see Quebec. I‘m excited about Quebec‘s economy, the beauty of the province and the people‘s sense of community. Quebec is one of the first places in Canada that you‘ve got a chance to visit. The government of Quebec has done a tremendous job over the last decade, not only in terms of education, infrastructure, health care, and economic growth but also on social issues and social welfare. I can‘t wait to experience it first hand, even though it will be very cold there.;238.13025021972135;3.731905962806195;6;0;3;3;2;3;2;4
