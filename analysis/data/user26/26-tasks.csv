264;1;2;The road trip we went for last vacation , was a lot more of a trip, and it's really about me. I'm more like a trip leader for the trip, and I have a vision that I want to get to with the team, and that vision is to get this win. So when you're on a road trip, it's hard to get any time off of the team, but that's what I was able to do. I didn't have a lot of time, so it was nice to get to work with our guys and be with my friends. It was awesome to be around them and know they really wanted to get it done.;138.25671532889828;4.26664327736944;22;8;5;5;4;4;4;3
