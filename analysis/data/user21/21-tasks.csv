210;1;0;On last weekend I went on a short vacation with couple of my friends. We visited the city of Berlin. The trip was decided quite spontaneously but it turned out to be a memorable one. On our first day in Berlin we explored the city center and went on pub crawl at night. While on the second day, we visited museums and art galleries and also visited places with historical significance. In the evening we had a relaxing time around lake shore. It was a fun trip.;425.6873777;0;0;0;4;5;4;4;4;3
211;1;1;On last weekend, I went on a vacation to the United States. I'm a big fan of baseball and basketball. I'm very active and healthy. So I took a long weekend off from work and spent the whole weekend with my friend, James, and his family, all on the beach. I spent almost the entire day with James and his family and had some time to go and enjoy our own beach. We had a wonderful time and got some good food, and we went swimming, which is pretty awesome.\nAs James and I talked, we both decided to go back to the hotel to get some sleep. We were both pretty tired.;311.53854946698993;5.036795055028051;8;0;4;5;4;4;5;5
