163;1;2;This summer I went to Croatia! We got into the city centre, and the locals were nice. The best part was that the locals also came with their families to watch us and see the sights! \n\nWe were staying with my parents at a hotel in the small town of Štjan.;145.5162580795586;1.3753609885461628;7;1;4;3;3;4;4;4
164;1;0;Last summer I went to Greece with my beautiful boyfriend. We stayed there a whole week and loved the time. On the first day we weren’t so happy about the restaurant because the food wasn’t the best. But maybe this was good for us because my boyfriend didn’t eat as much as at home. I really liked the time there and hope we will repeat it;139.24552477663383;0;0;0;5;4;5;3;3;3
165;1;1;I went to Croatia this summer for three weeks, and the whole time I was in Croatia I was thinking 'How am I going to go to work?' 'How am I going to feed my kids?'". The weather was so hot that the locals had to cook the vegetables themselves, and while there were lots of fun times, it was a lot of fun ;106.15492611611262;1.2447621691972017;2;0;2;2;1;2;2;2
