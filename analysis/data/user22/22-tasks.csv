223;1;2;This summer I am heading to Japan to explore, but I am also hoping to visit some of the places that have been inspired by my travels , like Mount Fuji, the city of Nagoya, and a place called Tsuru, which is actually one of the most beautiful mountain ranges in Japan.Â Â I ll post a picture of the trip when I get there, but here are some pictures that I took as I was on my way to Nagoya.;78.2475399710238;1.910133820027113;10;0;5;5;3;5;5;5
224;1;0;This fall I am going to visit Japan. I am excited to find out if the atmosphere is like I imagine it from movies and stories. Some people say it's like visiting a whole new planet. There will be a lot of different places. Large cities and a lot of nature as well. Hopefully I will bring back a lot of cool pictures.;130.9505664529279;0;0;0;4;4;5;4;1;1
225;1;1;This fall I will visit Japan. It is a very big country, a country that I know well. Japan has been a source of inspiration for me over the years. I think the culture of the country has changed significantly in the last two or three decades. I've visited different parts of Japan, including Kyoto, Hiroshima, Kobe, and I've met with people in different areas. And I think the Japanese people are different from the people in the United States. I believe in being able to learn from each other and share our experience.;174.78616088768467;3.0361227984540164;5;0;3;3;2;2;3;5
