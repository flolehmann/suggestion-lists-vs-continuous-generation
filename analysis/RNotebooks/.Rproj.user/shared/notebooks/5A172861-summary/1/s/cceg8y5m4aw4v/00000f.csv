"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict time_minutes with method (formula:
time_minutes ~ method). The model included task as random effects (formula: list(~1 | task, ~1 | subject)). The model's total
explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.52) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.06.
The model's intercept, corresponding to method = 0, is at 2.44 (95% CI [1.70, 3.17], t(102) = 6.59, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of method [1] is statistically significant and positive (beta = 1.09, 95% CI [0.49, 1.70], t(102) = 3.61, p < .001; Std.
beta = 0.60, 95% CI [0.27, 0.93])
  - The effect of method [2] is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.71, 95% CI [0.11, 1.31], t(102) = 2.35, p = 0.021;
Std. beta = 0.39, 95% CI [0.06, 0.72])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs)
and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
